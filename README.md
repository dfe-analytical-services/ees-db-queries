# EES database queries

This repo (evolving towards a package) contains common queries useful to the maintenance and monitoring of the EES database.

Some of the scripts will be useful while following instructions for manual database tasks following guides in the [EES project wiki](https://dfe-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/s101-Explore-Education-Statistics/_wiki/wikis).
